# NetFrontier
Net Frontier is an open-source multiplayer game project that focuses on building both server and client-side code for a 2.5D platformer MMORPG. The project aims to provide a scalable, dedicated server architecture while developing a client that can be used by players to connect and interact within a shared online world.
