Why We Need the .dlls for Session Management and JWT in Unity

In the context of using Unity for database-driven applications like an MMO-style game, where session management and secure authentication are essential, we need certain external libraries (.dll files) to handle specific tasks. These libraries provide functionality that isn't natively available in Unity’s default setup, especially when interfacing with external services such as a database or authentication server.

Here’s an explanation for each of the .dlls we are including:
1. MySql.Data.dll

Purpose: Provides support for connecting and interacting with a MySQL database.

Why We Need It:

Use Cases:

    Registering users in the game.
    Validating login credentials against the database.
    Storing session tokens for logged-in users.
    Retrieving data like high scores, game progress, etc.

2. System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt.dll
    Unity doesn’t have native support for MySQL. To connect to a MySQL database, execute queries, and manage user data, we use the MySql.Data.dll library.
    It allows us to handle player data, such as logging in, registering new users, storing session tokens, etc.


Purpose: Implements support for JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This is used to securely manage authentication tokens that represent a user's session.

Why We Need It:

    JWT tokens are a secure way to manage and verify user authentication across sessions.
    They are used in modern web-based and game applications to create a stateless authentication system, where the server does not need to store session data but can verify the user's authenticity based on the token.
    The System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt.dll provides the necessary tools to create, sign, and validate JWT tokens in our Unity project.

Use Cases:

    Generating JWT tokens upon successful user login.
    Validating the token for each request from the player to ensure they have an active and valid session.
    Token expiration and refresh management for long-term game sessions.

3. Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.dll

Purpose: Provides additional cryptographic and token-related functionality that works in conjunction with System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt.dll to create, sign, and validate JWT tokens securely.

Why We Need It:

    The Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.dll is responsible for managing the encryption and signing of tokens. This ensures that tokens can be securely validated and are protected from tampering.
    It provides support for cryptographic operations like RSA, HMAC, and other algorithms necessary for token validation and security.
    This is essential for preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that user sessions are secure and trusted.

Use Cases:

    Signing the JWT tokens with a private key to ensure they can’t be tampered with.
    Validating that incoming tokens are correctly signed before granting access to resources.
    Encrypting sensitive data within tokens to enhance security.

Summary of Why These .dlls Are Important:

In summary, these libraries are essential for building a secure, database-backed authentication system within Unity. They allow us to:

    Connect and interact with a MySQL database (MySql.Data.dll).
    Create, sign, and validate secure JWT tokens for user sessions (System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt.dll and Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.dll).

Without these libraries, Unity would lack the ability to securely handle user authentication, session management, and database interactions, all of which are critical for any multiplayer game or application requiring secure user management.
Why API Compatibility Level Matters:

We set the API Compatibility Level to .NET Standard 2.1 (or 2.0) because these libraries are designed to work with modern versions of the .NET framework. Ensuring compatibility with .NET Standard allows us to use the features provided by these libraries without issues, as Unity will be able to recognize and utilize the full functionality of these external libraries.
